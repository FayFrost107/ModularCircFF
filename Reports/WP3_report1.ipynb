    "\n",
    "This report details the work conducted for WP3, the uncertainty quantification and calibration of cardiac models. The primary model used for this study was the 0D model Korakianitis and Shi (Figure 1), from which we simulated right heart pressure traces and cardiac output. We focused on calibrating five key model parameters while keeping the others fixed. These five parameters were selected via a gloal sensitivity analysis of the model and through expert advice from other members of the project. All simulations were performed using Max's `ModularCirc`. \n",
